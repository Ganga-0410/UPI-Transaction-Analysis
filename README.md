✅ Gender Trends: 👨 Males accounted for 70% of the total transaction amount
✅ Common Failure Reasons: 🔄 Network issues & insufficient balance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **🔹 Power BI**: Used for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **🔹 DAX**: Custom calculations for KPI metrics.

## 📂 Dataset Fields
The dataset contains transaction details with the following key fields:
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **PaymentMethod**: UPI ID, QR Code, or Phone Number.

## 📌 DAX Measures Used
1. **Failure Rate Calculation**
   ```DAX
   Failure Rate = 
   DIVIDE(
       COUNTROWS(FILTER('UPI Transactions', 'UPI Transactions'[Status] = "Failed")),
       COUNTROWS('UPI Transactions'),
       0
   ) * 100
